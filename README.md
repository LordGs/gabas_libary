# Library System with JWT
A simple library system with secure access management using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This project allows users to manage a collection of books and authors while ensuring security through token rotation, so each token is single-use only.

## Features
1. **User Registration:** Create an account to access the library system.
2. **Token-Based Authentication:** Authenticate to obtain a unique JWT for secure database operations.
3. **Token Rotation:** Each JWT is single-use and replaced after an action, preventing token reuse.
4. **CRUD Operations:**
	- Insert: Add new books and authors to the database.
	- Update: Modify existing records.
	- Delete: Remove books and authors.
	- Retrieve: Access information on stored books and authors.

## Technologies Used
1. Backend: PHP (with Slim Framework)
2. Database: MySQL
3. Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with token rotation

# HOW TO USE?
1. First Things first is to make sure the database `gabas_library.sql` was imported in your database
    - This can be found in ```gabas_library/database/gabas_library.sql``` path
2. Create an account using the **Register** Payload then authenticate by **Authenticate** Payload
3. To use **Insert, Update, Display, Delete Books** Payloads, Copy the `<generated-token>` generated by the authenticate;
    - Go to **Headers** of your Postman or Thunderclient
    - Add **Authorization** in header and paste the `<generated-token>` inside the value next to the **Authorization**
